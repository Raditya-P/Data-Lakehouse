# Data Lakehouse Architecture by Raditya P

## Introduction

This project presents a complete *data lakehouse* architecture that integrates various technologies to manage large-scale data effectively. The system combines the flexibility of *data lakes* and the structured capabilities of *data warehouses*, making it ideal for scenarios requiring the storage and processing of large datasets. This architecture can be applied in a variety of use cases, including cybersecurity, finance, and analytics.

The system integrates **MinIO**, **Apache Hive**, **Apache Iceberg**, **Trino**, **MariaDB**, and **Metabase** to provide a comprehensive solution for data ingestion, storage, querying, and visualization.

## Architecture Overview

The data lakehouse system is composed of the following components:

1. **MinIO**: 
   - MinIO is an S3-compatible object storage solution used for storing large volumes of unstructured and structured data in various formats (CSV, Parquet, etc.). It acts as the storage layer for the data lakehouse.

2. **Apache Hive**:
   - Apache Hive is used for managing metadata related to the datasets stored in MinIO. It allows the creation of external tables that provide structure to raw data, making it easier to query.

3. **Apache Iceberg**:
   - Apache Iceberg provides table management and supports schema evolution, transactional guarantees, and partitioning for optimized queries and data storage. Iceberg is used to manage processed data.

4. **Trino (formerly Presto)**:
   - Trino is a distributed SQL query engine that enables fast and scalable querying of data across both raw (Hive) and processed (Iceberg) datasets. It allows users to perform complex SQL queries efficiently.

5. **MariaDB**:
   - MariaDB serves as the backend for the Hive Metastore. It stores metadata about the data (e.g., table schemas, locations) in a relational database format, ensuring that the metadata is easily queryable and consistently managed.

6. **Metabase**:
   - Metabase is a data visualization and reporting tool that connects to Trino, allowing users to create dashboards and generate insights from the data stored in Iceberg tables.

## System Design and Implementation

### Data Flow Process

1. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - Data is ingested into MinIO as the object storage. This data can be in various formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.), and it serves as the raw input for the rest of the system.

2. **Metadata Management with Hive and MariaDB**:
   - Apache Hive uses MariaDB as its metastore to store metadata about the data in MinIO. The metadata includes schema definitions, table properties, and data locations. Hive provides structured access to the unstructured data stored in MinIO.

3. **Data Processing with Trino**:
   - Trino is used to process and query the raw data stored in Hive. It allows real-time SQL-based analysis and supports large-scale data processing across distributed datasets.

4. **Storing Data in Apache Iceberg**:
   - The processed data is stored in Iceberg tables, which provide advanced features like schema evolution and ACID transactions. Iceberg ensures that data is managed in a scalable, reliable, and efficient manner.

5. **Querying and Analytics**:
   - Trino allows users to run SQL queries on both raw and processed data. Users can perform data transformations, aggregations, and other analytical tasks.

6. **Data Visualization with Metabase**:
   - Metabase is connected to Trino, enabling users to create visual dashboards and explore data insights interactively. This allows for real-time data exploration and business intelligence reporting.

### Key Features

- **Scalability**: The system is designed to handle large datasets and can scale horizontally as data volume increases.
- **Flexibility**: It supports various data formats and can process both structured and unstructured data efficiently.
- **Transactional Support**: Apache Iceberg ensures that data operations are ACID-compliant, providing consistency and reliability.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Trino enables real-time querying and analysis, making it possible to derive insights instantly.
- **Metadata Management**: Hive and MariaDB provide robust metadata management, allowing the system to track and manage data schemas, partitions, and other properties seamlessly.

## How It Works

1. **Start Docker**:
   - The entire architecture is containerized using Docker. Start all services, including MinIO, Hive Metastore, MariaDB, Trino, and Metabase, using Docker Compose.

2. **Ingest Data**:
   - Upload raw data to MinIO, which serves as the object storage layer. This step can be done through MinIOâ€™s web interface or CLI tools.

3. **Create Metadata in Hive**:
   - Use Apache Hive to create external tables for the data stored in MinIO. This step registers the metadata in MariaDB, allowing structured queries on unstructured data.

4. **Process Data with Trino**:
   - Query the raw data using Trino to clean, process, and transform it as necessary. Trino's distributed architecture enables high-performance data queries and analytics.

5. **Store Processed Data in Iceberg**:
   - Save the cleaned and processed data in Iceberg tables to benefit from schema evolution, partitioning, and transactional support for long-term storage.

6. **Visualize Data in Metabase**:
   - Connect Metabase to Trino to create visualizations, dashboards, and generate business intelligence reports based on the processed data.

## Conclusion

This *data lakehouse* system provides a comprehensive architecture for managing and processing large-scale data. By integrating **MinIO**, **Apache Hive**, **MariaDB**, **Apache Iceberg**, **Trino**, and **Metabase**, the system enables flexible, scalable, and efficient data storage, processing, and analysis. It combines the best features of both *data lakes* and *data warehouses* to support a wide range of use cases, from real-time analytics to long-term data storage with transactional support.
